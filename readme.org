A sample CrowdAnki =deck.json= to help investigate a possible bug.

* To reproduce:

1. Import this deck with CrowdAnki.

   =CrowdAnki: Import git repository= > =https://github.com/aplaice/crowdanki_deck_config_export_test=.

2. Change the deck's options group, say to =Default=.

3. Export the deck with CrowdAnki.

4. Import the exported deck with CrowdAnki. (=CrowdAnki: Import from disk=)

(Interestingly, it's not even necessary to start a fresh profile before *4*! This is presumably because in =crowd-anki/representation/deck.py:173=, we only care about the deck configs present in the CrowdAnki JSON.)
